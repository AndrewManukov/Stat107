    "SLEEP! It's a beautiful thing that most of us don't get enough of!  There has been a lot of research done looking the amount of sleep different people get on average.  The following is an example of one of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2013, [Gallup completed their latest survey on sleep](https://news.gallup.com/poll/166553/less-recommended-amount-sleep.aspx) that shows that the average amount of sleep Americans get is 6.8 hours ($\\mu = 6.8$). This seems a bit low, right? How do you think our class average in Data Science DISCOVERY compares to this? It might be less than 6.8 or it may be more than that. Let's find out if the ideal hours of sleep STAT 107 students would get is significantly different from the average amount of sleep that all Americans get reported by Gallup. For the sake of this lab, assume our survey data is a random sample from the population (Americans).\n",

    "Run a **hypothesis test** to find out if the data we have is significantly different from the population/Gallup poll. \n",

    "You need to look at the Day 1 Dataset (from the first week of class) which gives you the ideal amount of sleep Stat 107 students get each week.
